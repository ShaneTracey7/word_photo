Check out my photo to character array converter: https://shantrac.pythonanywhere.com/home/

Purpose:

My phone plan prevents me from sending images over text, so I decided to create an application to do the next best thing. Currently, this project is in the form of a web app, but I'm working on creating an iOS keyboard extension version.

What it does:

A web app that converts images into an array of keyboard characters that form the image.

How to use:

- select an image file from your computer (by clicking the shutter button)
- select the size (small, medium, large, x-large) of the character array output by using arrow buttons on the dial
- click the 'set' button in the middle of the dial to convert
- once the converted image is displayed, you can either hit the 'copy' button to copy to your clipboard, or the 'reset' button to go back to the beginning
- information regarding the line spacing, font size, and line height is given, so you can identically recreate the converted image in the word editor/document of your choosing
